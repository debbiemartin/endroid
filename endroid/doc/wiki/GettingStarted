= Installation =

Installing EnDroid is straightforward. Installation packages are provided (currently only for Ubuntu) [[https://launchpad.net/endroid/+download|on Launchpad]]. It is also possible to run it directly
by checking out the code using `bzr branch lp:endroid`.

  Note: !EnDroid requires python 2.7 or later to run, and depends on Twisted, Wokkel, PyTZ, treq, jinja2 and python-dateutil.

In order to run EnDroid needs to load certain settings from its config file. An example one is at `/usr/share/doc/endroid/examples/endroid.conf` if !EnDroid has been installed or in the 
source repository at `etc/endroid.conf`. The settings that must be added to the config file are details of an XMPP account for !EnDroid to use (free accounts can be created easily e.g. from 
[[http://www.jabber.at/|jabber.at]]). 

 Note: '''Do not use your own account''' as !EnDroid will cut down its contact list to users listed in the config file.

Other settings that should be set are `users` - the list of users !EnDroid will communicate with - remember to add yourself to this and `rooms` the list of rooms !EnDroid will join. For more details
on configuration see [[../Configuration|configuration]].

= Running EnDroid =

 * If you installed !EnDroid, you should be able to run it by typing `endroid` into the console.
 * If you pulled the source, run !EnDroid using `src/endroid.sh`
 * See `-h` for full list of command line arguments, some key ones are:
   * `[-c <config-file>]` - specify an alternative config file.
   * `[-l|--level] <log-level>` - specify the verbosity of the console log (lower is more verbose)
   * `[-L|--logfile] <log-file>` - redirect the console logging to a file.
   * `[-t|--logtraffic]` - log all the raw message xml to the file log.

See the [[../Debugging|debugging page]] for more details on logging and `Manhole`.
