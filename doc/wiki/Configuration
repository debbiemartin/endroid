== Basic Configuration ==

!EnDroid reads all of its config from a single configuration file, searched for at (in order):
 * conffile as specified on the command file e.g. `endroid.sh <conffile>`.
 * `ENDROID_CONF` environment variable.
 * `~/.endroid/endroid.conf` (recommended)
 * `/etc/endroid/endroid.conf`

An example config file can be found at `/usr/share/doc/endroid/examples/endroid.conf` if !EnDroid has been installed or in the source repository at `etc/endroid.conf`.
The basic sections of the config file are described below:

{{{#!python
# Comments are denoted by a hash character in the first column

[Setup]
# EnDroid's Webex Teams authorization token must be specified so that EnDroid
# can send messages and open its web socket
authorization = myauthorizationkey

# EnDroid's full contact list. Users on this list will be added as friends,
# users not on this list will be removed from contacts and will be unable
# to communicate with EnDroid.
users =

# What rooms EnDroid will attempt to create and join. Defaults to []
# rooms = room1id,

# What usergroup EnDroid will register plugins with. Defaults to ['all']
# groups = all, admins

logfile = ~/.endroid/endroid.log

[Database]
dbfile = ~/.endroid/endroid.db

# a section matching groups and rooms with any name
[ group | room : *]
plugins=
#    endroid.plugins.<your_plugin>,
#    endroid.plugins.<other plugin your plugin depends on>,
#    ...
}}}

== Some Notes on Syntax ==

 * !EnDroid will try to interpret values in the config file as Python objects, so `my_var = 1`.
 * Bools will only be converted if they are `True` or `False` (i.e. capitalised).
 * Lists are detected by commas or newlines:{{{#!python
my_list = multiple, entries, present
my_list2 = newlines
    also
    mean
    lists
}}}
 * For a list with a single item, a comma must be present at the end of the list:{{{#!python
expects_a_list1 = foo
# Will result in a string foo not a list

expects_a_list2 = foo,
# Will result in a list of items with only one entry - foo
}}}
